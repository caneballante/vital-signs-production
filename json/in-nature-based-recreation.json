Recreational activities tracked are limited to those within the scope of Puget Sound recovery and include both passive and active recreational activities, such as wildlife-watching, fishing, bicycling, boating, and swimming. ~PWe have just begun collecting data for this indicator. Further data will be collected every 2 years via a survey of Puget Sound residents about their outdoor recreation habits. The results will be reported as the average time Puget Sound residents spend per week engaging in seasonal outdoor recreation activity.  All data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",

The number drops to about 50% for the winter. We anticipate more data will be collected within the next 2 years, with assessment of trends and progress within the next 4 to 6 years."
