    "progress-description": "The status and trends results for toxic chemical contamination in Pacific herring are mixed. For both PCBs and PBDEs, the levels in most herring stocks are still not meeting the 2020 target values, however PBDEs are showing signs of improvement, with levels dropping in all four populations. ~SL In the more urbanized central and south Puget Sound basins, PCBs remained high and showed no significant declining trend over the past 15 years. Virtually all of those central and southern herring failed to meet the PCB 2020 target. ~B In northern Puget Sound, both PCBs and PBDEs have declined in two herring stocks at annual rates of 2% to 4% (PCBs) and 4% to 8% (PBDEs) over the past 15 years. The most recent levels in that basin have met (or nearly met) the PCB recovery goal in 2014 (95% of samples below CTL). ~B PBDEs have declined in the two herring stocks from southern and central Puget sound at annual rates of 5% and 7%, however their levels have not yet met the 2020 target.",
	"what": "Pacific herring are small schooling fish that are important prey for salmon and other fish species, birds and mammals. Herring feed and move around in Puget Sound's pelagic (open water) environment, and lay their eggs in nearshore spawning grounds throughout the sound (see the Pacific herring spawning biomass indicator). The levels of toxic chemical contaminants in herring signal whether the health of pelagic species is at risk, while also indicating the degree to which their predators may be exposed to chemicals as a result of consuming herring. ~P It is difficult to impossible to measure contaminants directly in many pelagic predators including seals, dolphins, killer whales, and fish-eating seabirds. Herring provide a more practical approach for measuring contaminants in the pelagic food web, as they are abundant and relatively easy to capture and process in the laboratory. ~P The contaminants currently monitored in Puget Sound herring are: ~SL Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemicals that were designed for various industrial uses, and which were banned in the US in 1979. ~B Polybrominated diphenylethers, (PBDEs), designed for use as flame-retardants in many products, and which were banned in 2011 in Washington State.~B Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), produced primarily from burning fossil fuels and from oil spills. ~EL ~P PCBs and PBDEs are measured directly in the herring's whole body. The resulting values not only reflect the amount of contaminants in the herring themselves, but also allow an assessment of how much toxic chemicals predators may be exposed to when consuming herring. ~P PAHs are measured differently than PCBs and PBDEs. Unlike PCBs and PBDEs which build up in fish tissues over time, PAHs are metabolized, or broken down inside the body of the fish. Thus, the break-down products of PAHs (metabolites) in the herring are what’s measured. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are not currently measured in this species. ~P To determine whether the contaminants are above or below levels deemed harmful for fish, contaminant concentrations are compared against the “Critical Tissue Levels”. Critical Tissue Levels are typically a numerical value (or range) established experimentally and published in the scientific literature, and are considered the agreed-upon level (or range) at which fish health is at increased risk. ~P The amount of contaminants is reported here for four populations of Pacific herring covering a wide area of Puget Sound from its southern basin (Squaxin stock) and central basin (Port Orchard/Madison stock) northward to the Canadian border (Semiahmoo and Cherry Point stocks).",

Top and bottom of boxes indicate 25th and 75th percentile and diamonds indicate 5th (lower) and 95th (upper) percentile. The 2020 target is met if the upper diamond is below the Critical Tissue Level, which is illustrated by the dashed line. The red-yellow-green stoplight colors represent a scale of caution derived by integrating both status and trends data. Green indicates the 2020 target has been met and trends are not worsening. Yellow indicates either the 2020 target has not met but the trend is improving, or the target has been met but the trend is worsening. Red indicates that the 2020 target was not met and the trend is either worsening or not improving. ",

	"why-happening": "The consistent decline in PBDEs across all herring stocks from both urbanized and less urbanized basins likely resulted from successful statutory and voluntary PBDE controls on both production and use of these chemicals in Washington State. ~P The high concentration of PCBs and lack of their decline in herring from the central and southern basin highlight the persistent nature of these chemicals and also a failure to control PCBs still entering Puget Sound waters. The wide-ranging nature of herring, combined with PCB contamination of other similar pelagic fishes (West et al. 2011), their prey (West et al. 2011) and their predators (see the resident Chinook salmon indicator page and O'Neill et al. 2009) illustrate significant, pervasive PCB contamination of Puget Sound's pelagic food web.",
