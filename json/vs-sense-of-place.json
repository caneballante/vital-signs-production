		"what": "The Sense of Place Vital Sign is a composite of two separate indices and a baseline measure of satisfaction derived from existing national survey data.  Sense of place is defined as the extent to which people identify with and feel positively attached to a specific place.  Several studies have demonstrated that not only does a strong sense of place contribute to human wellbeing, but that it can also contribute to a desire to protect the natural environment.  Sense of place is clearly linked to other human wellbeing measures, particularly cultural and psychological measures, and is thus an informative, all-encompassing measure of wellbeing. The measure of overall life satisfaction will be used as a baseline against which to assess changes in status of most of the other Human Wellbeing indicators.  ",
