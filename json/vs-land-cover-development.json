		"what": "During the past 50 years, Puget Sound lost at least two-thirds of its remaining old growth forest, more than 90% of its native prairies, and 80% of its marshes. The need for homes, businesses, roads, and agriculture must be balanced with protection of the important functions provided by forested and riparian areas. This Vital Sign tells us about the gains (through restoration), maintenance (through protection) and losses of habitat (through development) and also how well we are directing our regionâ€™s ongoing growth to protect our best remaining natural areas and working forests.",
		"key-messages": "Coming soon!",
