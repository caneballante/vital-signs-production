		"progress-description": "Although awareness of soft shore techniques is increasing, most replacement projects and many new armor projects continue to use conventional structures. ~SLWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA) data provide a region-wide accounting of armor-related projects, but documentation of soft shore projects is incomplete and inconsistent.~B Soft shore projects are complex, often combine soft measures with conventional structures, and are subject to differing interpretations of what should be included, making documentation difficult. The lack of data on the use of soft shore techniques over time preclude a trend analysis.~B Property owners and coastal consultants are increasingly familiar with soft shore methods, but remain reluctant to employ them in the absence of better information about cost and performance.~B Soft shore techniques are to be used wherever feasible, but this is a subjective standard and many proponents feel strongly that these options are not feasible, particularly when erosion risks are high.~EL",
		"what": "Soft shore techniques describe measures that can reduce shoreline erosion with fewer of the environmental impacts associated with conventional hard structures such as bulkheads and seawalls. They include beach nourishment, the use of large logs, biotechnical methods using vegetation, and others techniques.~P Soft shore techniques are often used in combination with each other or with hard armor, making simple characterization difficult. In addition, the performance and benefits of soft shore techniques depend on the environmental setting and the prior condition of the project site (natural or armored).~P Understanding how soft shore techniques are used on Puget Sound is based on review of previous studies and guidance documents, along with review of relevant regulations, restoration programs, and outreach efforts. Data on recent armor projects, including the use of soft shore techniques, was obtained from the Aquatic Protection Permitting System (APPS) managed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to document and track Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA) permits.",

				"description": "While understanding and awareness of soft shore techniques is increasing, many armor projects continue to be built without them. Documenting these observations is difficult, however, as soft shore projects are tricky to define and experts can disagree about which projects should count. Soft shore measures represent a broad spectrum of designs, many of which are hybrids that combine hard and soft techniques, further complicating simple characterizations. The HPA data, our best source of information about armor-related projects, addresses soft measures inconsistently. As a consequence, we have little data on which to base conclusions about the use of soft shore techniques.~P For more information, please read Shipman 2017. https://pspwa.box.com/s/m3f408p0hut1t80vs14czgm9solk0mrd"

		"why-happening": "Soft techniques are encouraged by WDFW in HPA applications and local Shoreline Master Programs. The regulations require applicants to use soft shore methods wherever feasible. New design guidance is available that helps with both the selection and application of soft shore techniques. Property owner outreach and education programs, such as Shore Friendly, emphasize soft approaches (and removal of armor). Habitat biologists and local planners are increasingly aware of soft techniques and able to communicate that with applicants.~P Encouragement of soft shore projects has increased awareness of soft shore techniques and has led to more examples of successful projects, but widespread adoption is still affected by the lack of technical experience with soft techniques, limited confidence in their performance, and inevitable concerns about risks to property and safety on eroding or unstable shorelines.",
