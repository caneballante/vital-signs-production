	"what": "The Good Governance Index tells us how Puget Sound residents perceive the way decisions are made regarding management and use of the natural environment. The index is made up of 5 different indicators. The indicators offer insights for improving our overall decision-making processes, strengthening communication strategies, and strengthening the engagement of our partners and citizenry. An index is appropriate because the indicators are conceptually similar and often correlated. ~SL Indicator 1: Opportunity to influence decisions. Percent of residents who feel they have the opportunity to influence environmental decisions if desired.~B Indicator 2: Freedom to make decisions. Percent of residents who feel they have the rights and freedoms to make decisions about how the natural environment is managed.~B Indicator 3: Trust in local and regional government. Percent of residents who trust local and regional government to make the right decisions for protecting and recovering Puget Sound.  ~B Indicator 4: Representation in community and government leaders. Percent of residents who feel represented by community and government leaders.~B Indicator 5: Access to information: Percent of residents who obtain information about natural resource issues from pre-defined sources. ~EL~P We have just begun collecting data for this indicator. Further data will be collected every 2 years via a survey of Puget Sound residents about their general trust of regional policymakers to make good decisions about natural resources. Results will be reported as a mean index value. All data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",

			"description" : "Based on pilot data, about 30% of Puget Sound residents generally trust regional policymakers to make good decisions about natural resources.  For the Puget Sound population as a whole, this trust in government predicted 26% of people's overall life satisfaction (more than two times the importance of Sense of Place, Social and Cultural practices, and Outdoor Recreation).  Approximately 40% of residents feel that they have the freedom to make personal decisions about and have the opportunity to influence how natural resources are managed in the Puget Sound. About 30% of residents feel they are well represented by leaders who manage those resources. We anticipate more data will be collected within the next 2 years, with assessment of trends and progress within the next 4 to 6 years."
