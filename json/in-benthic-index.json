		"progress-description": "Progress toward these 2020 freshwater quality targets was mixed. Overall, biological condition at some sites is declining, improving at others, and not changing at most. ~SL Since 2006, the B-IBI scores of some streams have dropped from “excellent” to “good” or “fair”, indicating not all of the “excellent” sites have remained in excellent condition. In contrast, there has been net improvement in the biological condition of streams previously ranked fair by the B-IBI. ~EL",
		"what": "The Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) describes the biological condition of stream sites and their surrounding habitat based on the diversity and relative abundance of the benthic (bottom dwelling) macroinvertebrates found at the site. These macroinvertebrates include aquatic insect larvae, including mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, beetles, flies, dragonflies, as well as other invertebrates such as worms, snails, and many others. Ten measures of biological condition are scored and summarized as the B-IBI, which ranges from a score of 0, indicating a very poor stream condition, to 100, indicating excellent condition. ~P Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity data are routinely collected and reported by more than 20 local jurisdictions, tribes, and other state and federal organizations in Puget Sound for a variety of reasons. The Washington Department of Ecology samples 50 randomly selected stream and river sites every four years to get an unbiased estimate of regional conditions. Snohomish and King Counties also randomly select stream sites to estimate regional condition using the B-IBI. ~P Change over time is calculated as the difference in average scores between two time periods, 2006-2009 and 2013-2016. There were 354 sites across Puget Sound that were sampled at least once during both of these time periods.",

				"description": "Of the 18 Puget Sound stream sites that scored “excellent” between 2006 and 2009, only 8 (44 percent) maintained their excellent ranking (Part 1 of the target). However, 17 streams that had previously been ranked as fair or good have improved to excellent. Therefore, although fewer than half of the sites that had previously been excellent remained excellent, there are some other sites that appear to be improving and are now excellent. ~P Of the 100 stream sites that scored “fair” between 2006 and 2009, more stream sites improved (31 sites) than declined between in 2013-2016 (19 sites) (Part 2 of the target). It is unclear why there has been a net increase in scores at some sites when no restoration has been done, but the trend indicates some general trends in improvement at previously impacted sites."
