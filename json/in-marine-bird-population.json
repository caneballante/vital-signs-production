		"what": "The marine bird population indicator measures population abundance and trends of a handful of bird species that nest or overwinter in the marine environment. The indicator includes:~P 1. Spring/summer at-sea densities of marbled murrelet, rhinoceros auklet and pigeon guillemot. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of, and breed in, Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca.~P 2. At-sea abundance trends of scoter species that overwinter in Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but do not breed there. ~P The species selected for this indicator reside in Puget Sound most, if not all, of the year. The indicator provides an integrative view of the health of species that depend upon the Puget Sound for survival, in contrast to the species being indirect indicators of something like habitat quality, contaminants, or prey. ~P The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife conducts marine bird surveys in the spring/summer months and in January for wintering birds. The spring/summer surveys are boat-based and are part of the Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring program for the Marbled Murrelet (http://www.reo.gov/monitoring/reports/marbled-murrelet-reports-publications.shtml). During these surveys, observers also record other species detected. WDFW also conducts winter surveys from airplanes that allow us to assess abundance and trends of scoters and other over-wintering species (http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01135/).~P The marine bird indicator was officially endorsed by the Science Panel at their April 9, 2014 meeting. The endorsement was based on a peer-reviewed report written jointly by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Puget Sound Partnership. The report, titled “Marine and Terrestrial Bird Indicators for Puget Sound, (http://www.psp.wa.gov/vitalsigns/documents/Pearson%20and%20Hamel%20Bird%20Indicators%202013_Final.pdf) develops, presents, and uses a transparent process to identify and evaluate potential indicators and ultimately recommend marine bird indicators.~P The peer-review process was coordinated by the Puget Sound Partnership Science Panel in 2013. The report was finalized in April of 2014. The indicators were also endorsed by the Leadership Council in January 2014. Supplemental material to the report is linked here (Bird Indicator Supplementary material S1_2JAN13.xlsx, http://www.psp.wa.gov/vitalsigns/documents/Bird%20Indicator%20Supplementary%20material%20S1_2JAN13.xlsx).",

				"description": "Sound-wide, the density of pigeon guillemots and rhinoceros auklet has varied from year-to-year but with no overall trend over the past 16 years. In contrast, density of the marbled murrelet population has declined by nearly 5% per year over the past 16 years (95% CI = -7.7 to –2.1). The population size of marbled murrelets in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca in 2016 was estimated at 4,614 birds (95% confidence interval = 2,298 – 7,570 birds).~P For scoters (surf, black, and white-winged scoter species combined), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife developed a new data analysis and processing approach using data from 2014-2016. Estimate of trend over time using this new approach are not yet available. WDFW estimates that there were 50,920 (95% CI =50,000-52,000) scoters (black, surf, & white-winged scoters) in the Salish Sea. Eighty-eight percent of scoters were observed in shallow waters (less than 20 m depth). Across the Sound and Strait, scoter densities varied by region (basin), with high abundance in the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and moderate abundance in the South and Central Puget Sound. Similar data are currently being compiled for the years prior to 2014 and trends for scoters are forthcoming. More information can be found in the Marine Bird Density Atlas. (http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=2d7eb8143c3c49679dcf8af25ee20b0a&extent=-127.2413,46.3222,-119.1279,49.3197]). ~P <strong>REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND OTHER FACTORS INFORMING THE INDICATORS</strong> ~P <em>Marbled murrelet</em> ~P Although marbled murrelets spend the vast majority of its life at-sea foraging on fish, it is also dependent on forest habitats where it nests on branches of large trees. The species is federally listed as threatened. To better understand marbled murrelet decline, and to inform conservation planning to recover the species, researchers recently evaluated how terrestrial and marine factors influenced the distribution and abundance of the murrelet in coastal waters of the U.S. [provide link: https://reo.gov/monitoring/reports/murrelet/Raphael%20et%20al_2014_MAMU%20habitat%20associations_%20JMarineSyst.pdf]. ~P In 2016, researchers also completed a 20-year review of the status and trends of murrelet populations and nesting habitat [provide link:https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr933.pdf]. They found that the murrelet populations in California and Oregon did not exhibit a population trend while the Washington population was declining. They also found that numbers of birds on the water were positively correlated with amounts and pattern (large contiguous patches) of suitable nesting habitat, and that population trend was most strongly correlated with trend in nesting habitat although marine factors also contributed. Their results suggest that conservation of suitable nesting habitat is key to murrelet conservation, but marine factors, especially factors that contribute to murrelet prey abundance, may play a role in murrelet distribution and trend.

				"description": "~P<em>Rhinoceros auklet</em> ~P Rhinoceros auklets nest in burrows on two islands in Puget Sound, namely Smith and Protection Islands in the Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Peter Hodum (University of Puget Sound), Tom Good (NOAA Fisheries) and Scott Pearson (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife) have monitored the colony on Protection Island since 2006. Results indicate that burrow occupancy in 2016 (83%) was higher than the long-term mean (72 ± 6%; Fig. 2). Hatching success in 2016 (82% of eggs laid) was similar to the long-term mean (85 ± 5.5%; Fig. 2). However, fledging success in 2016 (49%) was much lower than the long-term mean (77 ± 10%; Fig. 2). This low fledging success is the lowest ever recorded for the island including estimates from the mid-1970s. ~P Over most years, long-term reproductive and population monitoring has been highly consistent across the decades. The exceptionally low fledging success coincided with an unusual number of rhinoceros auklets washing up dead on the beaches in the region [provide link: https://depts.washington.edu/coasst/news/breaking_news/RHAU%20Fact%20Sheet%209Aug16_2.1.pdf]. Although the cause of this mortality event are still under investigation, preliminary evidence suggests that bacterial infection was the primary cause of mortality. ~P Protection Island is a globally important nesting site for rhinoceros auklets with over 35,000 occupied burrows and is managed jointly by US Fish and Wildlife Service and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife [provide link:http://americanornithologypubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1525/cond.2013.110207 ] [https://www.fws.gov/refuge/protection_island/]."

				"description": "<em>Pigeon guillemot</em>~P Pigeon guillemots nest in crevices among boulders, under driftwood, or in man-made structures such as a wharf or pipe, or even on cliff faces. Ongoing citizen-science monitoring by local Whidbey Island residents from 2008 through 2016 [Provide link: http://pigeonguillemot.org/ ] and South Sound residents [Provide link: http://www.nisquallyestuary.org/research.html] indicates stable local populations. Local population results are consistent with the sound-wide trends in density trends obtained during the spring/summer boat-based surveys.~P The number of adult guillemots in the colonies nesting in the bluffs of Whidbey Island averaged 1,032 ± 33 birds. Occupied burrows, indicated by adults going into the burrow, averaged 244 ± 20 burrows. Burrows with chicks, indicated by prey delivery to the burrow, averaged 160 ± 12. These population and reproductive measures, like the sound-wide monitoring results above, suggest a stable and healthy guillemot population in the Puget Sound region."

		"more-description": "<em>Scoters</em>~P Three scoter species (surf, black and white-winged) over-winter in the Salish Sea. They spend about eight months of the year, with some non-breeding individuals here year-round. They are foraging, replacing their feathers and putting on weight needed to successfully reproduce in high arctic lakes in the summer. Recently published research by Vilchis et al. (2015) [Provide link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12378/abstract] indicates that over-wintering species were three times more likely to exhibit population declines in the Salish Sea than local breeders; for scoter, between 1994 and 2010, they declined in 9% of the 67 depth/basin strata evaluted. In general, Vilchis et al (2015) found that alcids (species like the marbled murrelet and common murre) and sea ducks (species like the scoters) dominated the over-wintering bird community during the 1990s, whereas non-diving bird species and diving species with diverse diets dominated the wintering bird community in the 2000s.",
