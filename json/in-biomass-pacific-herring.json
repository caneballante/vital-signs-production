    "progress-description": "Despite seeing minor increases in overall spawning biomass compared to the ten year average in 2015-16, none of the 2020 target values for individual Pacific herring stocks or groups of stocks are met. Overall, the current spawning biomass of all stocks is below both their respective 25-year mean reference and their 2020 target values.~SL The Cherry Point herring stock in North Puget Sound, once the largest stock in the Sound, has declined by over 96 percent since the earliest sampling date in 1973 and shows little sign of recovery.~B The Hood Canal Quilcene Bay stock has increased >240% over the past five years and now contributes over half of all Puget Sound herring spawning biomass. ~B The Squaxin Pass and other combined Puget Sound stocks do not exhibit the sharp decline seen in the Cherry Point stock. Although these stocks show broad annual fluctuations, they are relatively closer to their 2020 target values than the Cherry Point stock. In fact, in some years, these stocks have gone above their target values.~B Predicting the future condition of herring spawning biomass is difficult. Owing simply to natural fluctuations in abundance as a consequence of oceanographic and climatic parameters, the Squaxin and other Puget Sound stocks in Central and South Puget Sound may reach their respective target values again over the next five years. However, there is no evidence to suggest that herring spawning biomass at Cherry Point will increase in the near future and reach its target value by 2020, or that the biomass of all other stocks will be sustained at or above their target values.~EL",
	"what": "This indicator is the biomass of spawning Pacific herring. The biomass of spawning Pacific herring is the estimated annual tonnage of herring that are reproducing in Puget Sound. Based on former genetic studies that have identified three separate groupings of Puget Sound herring stocks, the Partnership has established three separate targets for Cherry Point, Squaxin Pass, and all other stocks combined. ~P Herring spawning biomass is currently based on spawn deposition surveys conducted by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to estimate the quantity of eggs deposited by herring on marine vegetation. Egg abundance is then converted to the estimated biomass of spawning herring, making assumptions about sex ratios in spawning aggregations, average female fecundity, and the area of the spawning grounds. As measured, the indicator only reflects the status of reproductive fish (males and females) rather than the status of the entire population because younger, immature age classes do not spawn. ~P Estimates of spawning biomass have been attempted for all known Puget Sound herring stocks by the Department of Fish and Wildlife annually since 1996, and for Cherry Point herring since the early 1970s. The baseline references, the 25-year mean biomass for each stock (1986 – 2010), are intended to provide perspective for the current status of each stock (the two-year mean of 2013 and 2014) and the targets. It should be noted that the baseline reference, evaluation of current stock status reported here, and the targets are not based on a conventional fishery stock assessment, which takes into account growth, maturity, fecundity and mortalities.",

			"description" : "The Puget Sound herring data are characterized by broad year-to-year fluctuations, which is typical of Pacific herring and other forage fish populations, and likely reflects natural environmental and demographic variability. Indeed, in Puget Sound, the bulk of the biomass of the “all other stocks” grouping is contributed by different stocks in different years, further implicating the role of site-specific variability.~P When spawning biomass is considered by basin or region, rather than genetic stock grouping, different trends emerge. The overall abundance of south and central Puget Sound herring stocks has remained “healthy” (as defined in Stick et al., 2014), but this is driven entirely by large increases in the Hood Canal Quilcene Bay stock (which has increased >240% over the past five years and now contributes over half of all Puget Sound herring spawning biomass). If Hood Canal stocks (Quilcene Bay and South Hood Canal) are excluded from the stocks in the Central/South Sound grouping, the latter have decreased dramatically and are now considered to be depressed (only 29% of the 25-year mean). Within Central/South Sound, two stocks (Wollochet Bay and Kilisut Harbor) have had no detected spawn over consecutive years and are now considered disappearances; two others are at critical levels, and four others are depressed. The Squaxin Pass stock is also assessed as depressed at this time (41% of the 25-year mean)."

	"why-happening": "The exact causes of the Cherry Point herring decline are unknown, but it has been attributed to many potential factors such as chronic pollution (e.g., PCB and PAH contaminants), oil spills, historical overfishing (no herring fisheries are currently allowed north of Admiralty Strait), parasites, disease, and changes in abundance of predators or prey. Changes to the natural shoreline, including nearby industrial construction and operation, may also play a role. Finally, the extent to which food-web interactions may limit herring populations, and how such interactions are mediated by the effects of climate change, are not well understood. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of these possible pressures.~P Several factors contribute to difficulties in understanding Cherry Point herring stock declines and in the trends of other herring stocks, including survey methods and exploitation rate analysis. Starting in 1973 at Cherry Point and 1986 for the rest of the stocks, the Department of Fish & Wildlife conducted a combination of Spawn Deposition surveys and Acoustic-Trawl surveys to estimate herring spawning biomass. Until 1996, the spawning biomass of the larger Puget Sound stocks typically was assessed by both methods each year, while the smaller stocks were surveyed by spawn deposition surveys every three years. Since 1996, duplicate assessment coverage was reduced and assessment for all known herring stocks was attempted each year by at least one survey method. Acoustic-Trawl surveys were discontinued in 2009 due to budget reductions, but spawn deposition surveys have been conducted annually for each stock since that time.~P In addition to spawning biomass, biological samples used to estimate growth, mortality, and recruitment were obtained from the Acoustic-Trawl surveys. These data, which are not currently being collected, are useful for assessing the stocks’ population dynamics and capacity to meet the targets, and to understand the mechanisms driving these trends.~P As mentioned above, not all spawning grounds/stocks have been surveyed every year, especially in the 70s and 80s. To complete the time series depicted in Figure 1, data gaps were filled in with the long-term average for the stocks with missing data. Given the importance of this indicator to the recovery of the Sound, monitoring methods and analysis should be reviewed and improved to more completely and accurately report status and trends.~P Commercial exploitation of Puget Sound herring is limited to a bait fishery, which is allowed to take up to 10% of the cumulative Puget Sound spawning biomass of Central and South Puget Sound stocks. These fisheries do not occur on the spawning grounds and target immature fish deriving from various stocks.  Landings in the past 10 years have ranged from 3% to 5% of this total and are not expected to increase significantly in the near future. This is a conservative exploitation rate, compared to a typical global exploitation rate of 20%. Although a 10% exploitation rate is precautionary, a more rigorous analysis of an appropriate exploitation rate, that accounts for current population dynamics (including age composition) and ecosystem needs (e.g., the extent of predator dependency on forage fish), is desirable to ensure sustainability of the Puget Sound herring population at large.",
