		"progress-description": "Because the trend in summer low flow of some rivers remained consistent with the 2020 target or improved, the overall conclusion for progress is that the status over the long-term has improved. However, trends have changed only slightly over the last several years.~SL Based on the trend and information for the period 1975 to 2016, 8 of 12 rivers (excluding the Elwha) met their target value. One more station is meeting the 2020 targets as compared to the period 1975 to 2011. Also, four of the stations have moved to an improved category (Nooksack, Skagit, Green, and Nisqually Rivers) while the rest have stayed the same. The 2016 interim targets were met. ~B The decreasing summer low flow trends for Issaquah Creek and the North Fork Stillaguamish, Deschutes, and Snohomish Rivers continue to be concerning. These rivers did not meet the 2020 target in 2011. In 2016, the rate of flow decline grew worse in the North Fork Stillaguamish and Snohomish Rivers as compared to 2015, despite more favorable hydrologic conditions. ~B The drivers for improvement have not been analyzed in detail. Weather patterns over the last several years that may have influenced the trends include several La Niña years that produced intense winter storms with heavy snow and rain, followed by the snowpack drought year of 2015 and a fairly average hydrologic year in 2016.~EL",
		"what": "Low flow occurs during summer months when there is less rain and warmer temperatures. Summer low flow is measured as the minimum 30-day average water flow at river and stream gaging stations maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey from July through October.~P The summer low flow indicator measures trends over a long time period. The indicator tracks how flow conditions are changing over the years, rather than comparing flow levels to a fixed value. The indicator is not sensitive to changes over a shorter time period, which makes it difficult to measure improving trends by 2020, even if significant flow restoration occurs. To measure a change, either large changes in flow must occur, such as a dam setting minimum downstream flows, or a very consistent change over a long period of time are needed.~PThe indicator tests whether the long-term trends of annual summer low flow levels are declining, increasing, or stable (no trend). The trend test uses data collected since 1975, representing over 40 years of measurements. The advantage of a long-term data set is that the influence of climate changes associated with regional cooling and warming cycles, such as the phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, are minimized over time.~PSpecific targets were created for 13 rivers in the 2020 Action Agenda. The target language makes a distinction between regulated rivers with there is one or more dam on the river and unregulated rivers. Rivers with large dams have highly managed flows and specified minimum mitigation flows that can have a large influence on the trends in summer low flows.",

				"description": "The 2020 target is limited to 13 rivers. To provide a more complete regional picture, 17 additional gages were also evaluated for the period 1975-2016. Of the 29 gages used to measure summer low flow (Table 1):~SL Sixteen gages are located near the mouth of major rivers or small streams that drain directly to Puget Sound. ~B Four gages are from upstream sites on the main stem of major rivers.~B Nine gages are from tributaries to major rivers.~EL ~P In general, flows were roughly about average in most Puget Sound rivers and creeks in 2016. Exceptions were the Skagit River at Marblemount, North Fork Stillaguamish, and Mercer Creek, which were in the lowest quartile of historic summer low flows. ~P Of the stations assessed in 2016, 55% had stable or increasing summer low flows (16 out of 29). The remaining 13 rivers have either weakly or strongly decreasing flows. Given the importance of adequate water supply for salmon, other wildlife and humans, some areas in Puget Sound may be cause for concern.~P Rivers regulated by dams with mandatory minimum downstream flows generally were stable or showed increasing trends (Skagit, Cedar, Green, Puyallup, Nisqually, and Skokomish Rivers). Some of the glacier-fed upper tributaries had increasing trends (North Fork Nooksack River, Puyallup River at Orting, Nisqually River near National). This could be the result of climatic warming trends and glacial recession.~P The Cedar River is another regulated river. The gaging station near Landsburg, located immediately below the reservoir but above the City of Seattle water diversion, had a weak decreasing trend, while the Cedar River at Renton (near the mouth of the river) showed a strong increasing trend. Summer low flows upstream were about twice the low flows downstream. The Cedar River is considered important habitat for salmon and these patterns suggest that the implementation of the City of Seattle Habitat Conservation Plan is improving summer low flows.~P Despite the thirteen rivers with either strongly or weakly decreasing flows meeting their interim targets, there remains cause for concern. Some of these water bodies, like Issaquah and Mercer Creeks are in urban areas. Others, namely the North Fork Stillaguamish, South Fork Snoqualmie, and Raging Rivers, are in areas experiencing population growth. The effect of increased impervious surfaces and ground and surface water withdrawals could be affecting those summer low flow levels. The Deschutes River gaging station is mostly forested land, so decreasing summer low flows in the upper Deschutes River may be due to a combination of forest practices and climate change. ~PThe Dungeness River showed a weak increasing trend for the upper watershed. Current work to restore flows in the developed areas of the lower watershed is occurring downstream of this gage."

		"why-happening": "A variety of factors are potential drivers for summer low flow trends. A more detailed analysis is needed to better understand these drivers. However, some observations are possible.~P The principal driver for summer low flows is weather conditions during the previous year. Puget Sound rivers and streams fall into three general categories:~SL <strong>Rain-dominated</strong>: these basins are at a low elevation where most precipitation is in the form of rain and any snow melts quickly. Summer flows are ground-water dominated.~B <strong>Transition, or mixed rain-snow</strong>: these are mid-elevation basins that may have winter snowpack but are also susceptible to rain-and-snow events or lack of snowpack in mild winters. Summer flows come from groundwater, but percolation of snowmelt can have a large effect.~B <strong>Snow-dominated</strong>: these basins have significant high elevation areas with deep winter snowpack. Summer flows may be affected by late snowmelt or glacier melt. ~P Summer low flows in streams are expected to track the weather conditions across the basin. Therefore, when a basin deviates from the regional tendency for the year, it suggests other drivers are in play. ~P Long-term trends in climate change may already be affecting flows in some systems. Glaciers are receding, and the increasing flows in rivers with large glaciers in the headwaters could reflect the rapid loss of glacial mass in the summer. Transition basins are expected to be the most sensitive to changes in snow pack. However, decreased percolation and higher summer temperatures could affect summer flows in rain-dominated basins, too. The specific effect of climate change on Puget Sound rivers and streams needs further analysis.~P Large dams provide the greatest impact on summer low flows. Prior to relicensing of the dams, summer low flows could be greatly reduced from natural conditions due to the operation of the dam to provide hydropower. However, over the last several decades dams have had minimum summer flows set in their licenses. As a result, flows below licensed dams are either stable or increasing, depending on how long the mitigation flows have been in effect.~P Direct diversion of flow from rivers in the summer can be a major driver of low flows. However, for most of the Puget Sound indicator gages there is relatively little agricultural flow diversion. Municipal diversions can have a large effect, but most of these now are subject to licensing requirements or salmon recovery plans. The Cedar River is a good example of this, demonstrated by its strongly increasing flows at the mouth.~P Recent research indicates that rapidly growing trees in forests harvested and replanted in the last several decades can contribute to lower summer flows. Studies from an experimental forest in Oregon showed that instream flows were lowest for stand ages of about 20-30 years. Based on calculations of stand age from satellite data, they were able so successfully predict summer low flows in a Puget Sound watershed from their experimental algorithms. This methodology should be explored further as part of analysis of low flow drivers.~P In developed areas, a major driver is changes in watershed hydrology. Wells can reduce ground water flow that feeds summer low flow, and impervious surfaces can reduce percolation that feeds ground water. Changes in hydrology caused by human activities are more likely to have an impact in urban and rapidly growing residential areas. The fact that many of the rivers and creeks with declining trends are in these areas suggests that this driver may be significant in urbanized or rapidly developing areas.~P More detailed analysis is necessary to understand how these many drivers interact in a given basin. A better understanding of the drivers that can respond to changes in watershed and water management could help prioritize basins with declining summer flow trends and direct resources to where they could have the most benefit. Additional resources would need to be identified to do this analysis.",
