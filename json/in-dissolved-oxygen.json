The model was recently updated to include processes in bottom sediments that affect dissolved oxygen. ~P The latest models show the following results for human contribution to the low oxygen problem.~SL Modeled oxygen depletion resulting from human-related inputs to Puget Sound is not within the target value of 0.2 mg/L for significant portions of the Puget Sound. ~B In several areas throughout Puget Sound, human-related modeled oxygen depletion of more than the target value of 0.2 mg/L persists for months.~B In local areas, including South Sound inlets and Skagit Bay, the magnitude of oxygen depletion caused by nutrient inputs from humans is much larger than the target value of 0.2 mg/L.~EL",
	  
	"what": "This indicator is the amount of dissolved oxygen in marine waters influenced by human impacts.~P Low dissolved oxygen in marine waters can create significant problems, such as extensive fish kills. The addition of excessive nutrients from human activities can create or exacerbate the conditions that lead to low oxygen in Puget Sound. Nitrogen can fuel algae blooms, which decompose and draw down oxygen. The human sources of nutrients include wastewater treatment plants, failed septic systems, and fertilizers that reach Puget Sound. ~P Processes leading to low oxygen can also create other problems such as high carbon dioxide in the water and more acidic waters.~P To reduce the frequency and severity of low dissolved oxygen and associated problems in Puget Sound, the Leadership Council adopted a target intended to minimize local human contributions that worsen low dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound. However, the issue is complicated by the fact that dissolved oxygen naturally exhibits a high degree of variability in marine waters, changing almost continuously with time of day, location, season, tidal cycle, depth, the mixing and movement of different water sources, and many other factors. Also, there are several main sources of nitrogen entering Puget Sound, including the ocean (generally the largest overall source), watershed sources (some of which are natural, and some of which are human), groundwater, and the atmosphere. Watershed sources include natural nitrogen inputs from forested land areas as well as increased nitrogen from developed land areas.~P Consequently, determining precisely the degree to which human inputs are responsible for a decline in dissolved oxygen, relative to the normal range of variability, is a complex issue. Addressing the issue requires a combination of good monitoring data, information on the sources of nitrogen, and sophisticated mathematical models.~P The Department of Ecology monitors oxygen throughout Puget Sound as part of the ambient monitoring program (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/mar_wat/data.html). The program includes monthly profiles of oxygen and related parameters, continuous monitoring at select moorings, and ferry-based monitoring of near-surface conditions. Oxygen data are also part of the Marine Water Condition Index (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/mar_wat/mwci.html), the other indicator under the Marine Water Quality Vital Sign.~P The target established by the Leadership Council focuses on how much human contributions worsen dissolved oxygen. Since this cannot be monitored directly, the Department of Ecology uses computer models to tease apart different influences. Many processes influence dissolved oxygen, including Pacific Ocean conditions, climate patterns, seasonal light and temperature, stratification and mixing, river and wastewater inputs, sediment processes, and biological processes. This Department of Ecology web site (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/Nitrogen/Index.html) summarizes what we know about nitrogen throughout the Puget Sound ecosystem.",

			"description" : "The Department of Ecology evaluated human impacts on oxygen in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea. Using modeling tools developed with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and recently updated to include simulation of sediment/water fluxes, Ecology determined that human sources from wastewater treatment plants and watersheds can cause more than 0.2 mg/L of dissolved oxygen depletion in widespread areas of Puget Sound (Figure 1). Human-related oxygen depletion of more than 0.2 mg/L occur for extended periods of time and persist in areas of Hood Canal, Carr Inlet, Budd Inlet, Port Susan, Skagit Bay and South Puget Sound for more than 250 days. Areas with limited flushing generally are most sensitive to inputs of nutrients, such as nitrogen, by humans. ~P Ecology also evaluated the magnitude of dissolved oxygen depletion caused by human sources from wastewater treatment plants and watersheds throughout Puget Sound. Human-related oxygen depletion of more than 0.2 mg/L (Figure 2) occur in Hood Canal, Port Susan and several inlets in South Puget Sound. In the eastern portion of Skagit Bay, human contributions of nutrients can cause dissolved oxygen to decline as much as 2 mg/L. "

			"description" : "Ecology also evaluated future conditions within Puget Sound in the face of increasing population, changes in the Pacific Ocean, climate shifts, and air temperature increases (Figure 3). By 2070, the population will likely double, oxygen could decline significantly in the Pacific Ocean, changes in snowpack will alter how much freshwater reaches Puget Sound, and the temperature will increase. Future population growth would worsen oxygen impacts, primarily in South and Central Puget Sound, at levels that would not meet the targets. Changes in river flows may offset impacts in some regions, but they could add to impacts in other regions of Puget Sound."

			"description" : "Declining trends in Pacific Ocean dissolved oxygen, if they continue, would decrease oxygen compared with current conditions throughout most of the region, with the greatest impacts closer to the Pacific Ocean and declining landward. Warming air temperatures would worsen oxygen conditions further, particularly in shallow bays. ~P Future conditions in our models are far more uncertain than current conditions. More work is needed to understand the trends in the Pacific Ocean and the likelihood they could continue. It is important to explore potential future conditions to help keep us informed of changes we may see in the near future."

	"why-happening": "Dissolved oxygen patterns reflect complex interactions of physics, chemistry, and biology. Concentrations vary tremendously around Puget Sound, near the surface or at the bottom, and during different seasons of the year. Using computer models, we have learned that most of this variation occurs due to conditions in the Pacific Ocean, climate influences, and circulation patterns within Puget Sound.~P Nutrients contributed by humans have the greatest impacts on South and Central Puget Sound because of the way water circulates. Near-bottom waters flow toward the southern end of Puget Sound, away from the ocean. These carry nutrients from both natural sources and human sources.~P Algae grow where they have ample light and nutrients. Poor circulation and warm temperatures enhance algae growth. As the algae die, settle to the bottom, and decompose, oxygen is used in the process. The dissolved oxygen target focuses on how much more algae growth occurs due to our human contributions. Nutrients from the Pacific Ocean and natural sources around Puget Sound fuel a natural level of algae growth that can be increased due to human contributions. The ends of inlets are particularly sensitive both to natural and to human sources of nutrients.~P Human nutrient inputs have increased over what would naturally flow to Puget Sound under forested conditions, and will continue to increase with our population. However, the Pacific Ocean provides far greater amounts of nitrogen to fuel algae growth within Puget Sound. Our human sources of nitrogen should still be controlled through existing management actions for multiple reasons, such as to protect the quality of our freshwater and groundwater. These may be more sensitive than Puget Sound itself.~P Understanding the impacts of local human activities on dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound is a long-term endeavor. We continue to improve our knowledge of what drives Puget Sound dissolved oxygen patterns through monitoring programs and modeling analyses.",
