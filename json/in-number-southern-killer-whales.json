		"progress-description": "The status of the Southern Resident killer whale population remains fragile. In 2010, the Partnership’s baseline reference, the census reported 86 individuals, and every year since then the population size has been smaller, except in 2011. ~SL The July 2017 census led by the Center for Whale Research reported 77 whales, down from 83 in 2016. The population is well below the interim target of 91 whales. ~BBetween July 2016 and July 2017, no new whales were born alive. Six whales died. ~BAs of September 2017, with the loss of J52, a two-and-a-half-year-old male, the Southern Resident killer whale population has dipped to 76 individuals. ~BGranny, a 105 year old female, passed away. The death of these older females means a loss of leadership and experience for finding food, posing an additional risk to the population. ~BRecovery of the population depends on increasing availability and access to its main prey—Chinook salmon stocks in the Salish Sea and along the West Coast. ~EL",
		"what": "Killer whales, also called orcas, are among Puget Sound’s most distinctive and charismatic inhabitants. They occupy an important niche at the top of the food web and support a multi-million dollar whale-watching industry. ~PSouthern Resident killer whales are a unique population of orcas that ranges in the Salish Sea and the West Coast. These whales eat fish and depend heavily on Chinook salmon for food. In the late-1990s, Southern Resident killer whales experienced a dramatic decline. The combination of a precarious food supply and threats from pollution, vessel traffic, and noise continues to jeopardize their survival. As a result, they are federally listed as endangered. ~PThe Southern Resident Killer Whale population in Puget Sound is actually a large extended family, or clan, comprised of three pods: J, K, and L pods. Although they can be seen throughout the year in Puget Sound, they are most often seen during the summer, especially in Haro Strait west of San Juan Island, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and in the Strait of Georgia near the Fraser River. ~PThreats to Southern Resident killer whales include contaminants, prey availability, vessels, and noise pollution. Additional human activities, such as underwater military activities, have been identified as a potential concern for killer whales, particularly on the outer coast. This issue has not been fully evaluated. Their small population size and social structure put them at risk for a catastrophic event, such as an oil spill, or a disease outbreak, that could impact the entire population. ~PResident orcas were chosen as an indicator because they are top-level predators, spend a portion of the year in Puget Sound to feed and socialize, and are threatened by some of the pressures on the Sound, such as pollution and declining salmon and herring runs. Although a robust orca population is an important recovery goal both at the state and federal levels, there may be limits to how much the orca indicator can tell us about the overall health of Puget Sound. The Southern Resident Killer Whale population migrates in and out of the area, and thus is not entirely dependent on Puget Sound and its resources. ~PThe census of the Southern Resident killer whale population, conducted annually by the Center for Whale Research, is an important method by which to assess the status and trends of this endangered population. The entire population is counted with a high degree of certainty using photo-identification techniques. Sighting networks throughout Puget Sound support the census. ~POther populations of whales, such as Transients and Northern Resident killer whales, also frequent the Salish Sea, but their numbers are not reported here because the indicator and target focus only on Southern Resident killer whales.",
