Access to safe drinking water is a critical determinant of human wellbeing.  In urban areas, cities provide treated drinking water to Puget Sound residents.  In more rural areas, small public water systems and wells are harder to track, but can be threatened by ground and surface water infiltration; the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers; and issues with water storage and distribution systems.
